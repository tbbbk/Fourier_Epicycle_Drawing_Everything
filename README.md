# **Fourier Epicycle Drawing** !EVERYTHING!

<img src="images\example.png" alt="example" style="zoom:50%;" />

This project provides an interactive visualization of Fourier series, capable of deconstructing any 2D path into a series of rotating vectors (epicycles) and then recreating the drawing.

## **Live Demo**

You can try the interactive demo here: [Click to View Demo](https://tbbbk.github.io/Fourier_Epicycle_Drawing_Everything/main.html)

## **Running Locally**

Open `main.py` and modify the `shape` lambda function to define your custom path.

- This project was heavily inspired by 3Blue1Brown's excellent video: [**But what is a Fourier series? From heat flow to drawing with circles**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dr6sGWTCMz2k).
- Special thanks to **Yuan Peng** for the invaluable help and guidance.
